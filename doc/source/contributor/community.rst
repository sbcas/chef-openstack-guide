Governance
==========

Chef OpenStack governance is well defined and `documented`_. It documents:

* The current Project Team Lead
* The mission statement
* The repositories managed by the group

PTL duty
========

While the official OpenStack PTL duty `guide`_ is general, the Chef
OpenStack PTL is usually in charge of:

* continuity of the project. This can include reviewing or writing code.
* OpenStack cross-project liaison.
* meeting organization.

Core reviewers team
===================

Chef OpenStack has a `core reviewers`_ team, that can merge any code in our
repositories.

Release management
==================

Releases are currently managed by the release `subteam`_. This is sometimes a
PTL task. This includes updating Supermarket.
